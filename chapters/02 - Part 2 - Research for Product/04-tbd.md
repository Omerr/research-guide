# Part 2 - Research for Product

## Chapter 3 - TBD NAME {#tbd-name}

In Part 1...

Part 2 focuses on what Research means in Software companies, especially those building products. Given common misconceptions regarding Research (as described in [chapter 2](#Research-and-development)), many organizations choose to not invest time and effort in Research tasks.

For some companies, it makes perfect sense. The reality of software companies is that there are always more needs, feature requests, and bugs, than time allows the current software teams to accomplish. Product Managers and Proejct Managers spend a vast portion of their time prioritizing between tasks, based on their impact and time estimations.

Research is nice and all. It's even exciting, to find out new things, answer questions that were completely open, and enable capabilities that you didn't know whether were even feasible. But in real life, your company needs to prioritize between so many tasks where success is practically guaranteed (that is, you know you can accomplish the task), with known time estimations. In this reality, it may seem almost irresponsible to prioritize a research task that might not bear fruit, and its time estimations are unclear at best. The risk of wasting time and resources on an open task is so great, that many organizations will simply never choose to pursue Research tasks.

In many software companies, no real Research is needed. You know your business needs, you know what needs to be done, and you need to focus on the challenging tasks of Product and Development to build the best Product. This is hard enough. Indeed, in these cases, the gains of Research is not great than the costs.

In same cases, Research is the differentiator between a successful product or company, and a failing one. Even in such cases, the risk is still valid - you can waste precious time of skilled people on Research tasks that will fail, or perhaps even worse - succeed but will fail to make an impact on the final product.

This poses a great responsiblity on those who lead Reseach tasks in the company. The leader would usually be a Team Lead, a CTO, a Tech Lead or a Product Manager.

The leader has two main responsibilities:

1. That the Research makes the biggest possible impact on the product.
2. That the Research is done in the most effective manner.

In this part of the book, you will focus on the first. In later parts (//TBD - which) you will learn about the latter.

Note that sometimes companies pursue research for other goals - such as marketing (by positioning themselves at the cutting edge of their field). In this case, the current chapter is only somewhat relevant, yet I believe that readers in such companies will learn from it as well.

## Connecting Research to Product Impact

In [chapter 2](#Research-and-development) you learned about the distinction between Research and Development tasks. There are many tasks that clearly fall into the Research category, but are simply irrelevant in a commercial setting. Research for the sake of creating knowledge is done in the academia, and has its own merits - but commercial organizations will (almost) never prioritize such tasks.

In software organizations, Research is often conducted to make a big product impact. That means that if you choose to lead a Research task, you must be aware that the real success of this task comes from its impact on the product, and not the technological success. It is extremely frustrating to have a research task complete, just to find out that it hasn't really made an impact - it is frustrating to the researcher, to their manager, and to the organization.

Whether you lead Research or conduct Research tasks yourself, you *must* be obsessive about connecting your research to the product. In this part you will get practical tools to do so.
