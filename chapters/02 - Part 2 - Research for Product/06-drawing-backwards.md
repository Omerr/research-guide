## Chapter 5 - Drawing Backwards {#drawing-backwards}

// In chapter 4...

Remember the spiral game introduced in [chapter 1]({#problem-solving})? As a reminder - the game looked like this:

In the image above - the duck is on spot number `41`. Each player, at their turn, moves the duck between 1 to 6 spots. So if the duck is on spot `41`, the player can move it to any spot between `40` and `35`. The player who moves the duck to spot `1` wins the game.

The key to solving this game was to start from the *end* and draw backwards. By working systematically from the end, you were able to:
1. Know what you were doing. Instead of just "trying out" things - you had a "system" - you worked your way systmetatically from spot `1` to `2` and then to `3` and so on.
2. Rely on the previous step. For example, you already knew that if you had the option and the duck were on spot `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` or `7` - you'd want to be first. You can thus easily deduce that if the duck were on spot `8`, you would want to be second.

Let us consider a different game.

If you are interested in trying out more similar games, I provided a few more in [Appendix A](#appendix-a).

In these games, the key was starting from the end of the game - either the duck being on spot `1`, or the state of both towers having `0` bricks, and drawing backwards systematically.

The same principle applies to making sure your Research efforts really make the desired impact.

Why is that?

Most importantly - because the "end state" is that where you reached your desired product impact, which is - as I stated before, your most important role.

Consider this example. At Swimm, we wanted to automatically generate documents from COBOL codebases that included all the extracted business rules. For those of you who aren't familiar with business rules, let me provide a short explanation just so you get a sense of the challenge at hand.

## Why Drawing Backwards is so Powerful

We can see the advantages of drawing backwards:
1. It forces you to connect to the business impact.
2. It provides a mechanism to progress when the Research seems like a huge, daunting task with endless options.
