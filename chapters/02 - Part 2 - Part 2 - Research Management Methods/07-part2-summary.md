## Part 2 Summary{#part2-summary}

**Effective Research** requires structured approaches, not just technical skill:
- The Research Tree visualizes solution paths, open questions, and closed questions.
- Time-boxing prevents endless exploration while preserving flexibility.
- Systematic evaluation helps you choose the best path forward.

**Your role** as a Research leader is to:
1. Ensure the team uses these methods consistently.
2. Help identify when to pivot, when to persist, and which questions matter.

**These tools prevent common failure modes**: jumping on the first idea, tunnel vision, inefficient learning, and lost context.

Part 3 shows how to connect Research to product impact.
