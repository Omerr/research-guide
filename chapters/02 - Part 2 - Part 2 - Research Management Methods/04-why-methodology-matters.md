## Chapter 3 - Why Methodology Matters: A True Story {#why-methodology-matters}

It was a late evening, and the classroom was filled with three dozen students. They were all sitting in front of their computers, working in silence. I was leading a cybersecurity training focused on reverse engineering. Each exercise included a single compiled program without its source code, with one goal: "understand how this program works." The output would be either a detailed document, an equivalent program implemented in a high-level language, or both.

This particular evening, the students were furiously working on reverse-engineering a game. The instruction was: "understand the game's rules, and document them thoroughly." The game had a user interface with two dimensions and could be played against the computer. Moving behind the students, I could see their screens with various reverse engineering tools open.

At some point we asked them to stop, turn around and look at the instructor. The instructor then provided a guided solution - this was a technique we used quite frequently, showing the students the "right" way to approach a problem they had spent some time tackling. The instructor opened the game, looked at the screen, opened the "File" menu, clicked on "Help" — and there it was, the entire description of the game rules.

### The Lesson

The room erupted in nervous laughter. Some students looked embarrassed. Others seemed frustrated. But everyone understood the point.

These were capable people. They had the relevant knowledge base, in Schoenfeld's terms, as presented in [chapter 1](#what-is-research). That is, they had the relevant technical skills — they knew both assembly and C, they knew how to use disassemblers, debuggers, and all the sophisticated tools of reverse engineering. Yet they had missed something fundamental: **checking if there was a simpler solution first**.

This happens all the time in Research work.

A team spends weeks diving deep into a complex technical approach, when a simpler path existed that they never explored. Or they try one thing, then another, then another - never systematically evaluating which approaches make sense before starting.

**The problem isn't capability. It's approach.**

This is exactly why you need structured methods for Research management. Without them, even your most talented people will waste time, miss obvious solutions, and burn out trying random approaches.

### What This Part Covers

The rest of Part 2 provides concrete tools to prevent these problems. You'll learn:

- **The Research Tree** - A visual framework for systematically exploring solution paths.
- **Time-boxing methods** - How to limit exploration without killing creativity.

These aren't abstract concepts. They're battle-tested techniques that directly address the failure modes you've probably seen: teams spinning their wheels, giving up too early, or getting stuck on the wrong approach.

Let's get started.
