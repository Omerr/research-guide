## Chapter 5 - Time-Boxing Research Explorations {#time-boxing}

In the previous chapter, you learned about the Research Tree, a powerful tool for visualizing and managing Research efforts. The tree helps you systematically explore different solution paths and keep track of open questions. It also helps you decide which path to try first.

Yet, how long are you willing to spend on a single research direction before deciding it's not working? Let's face it: it's hard, and even impossible to estimate how long a Research task will take. It's not uncommon to find, after a short time of work, something that changes our initial understanding of the problem, requiring us to pivot or try a different approach. But we should still provide time limits - based on how long we are willing to inveset in a specific research direction.

As a rule, for every task that is longer than a day, define a time limit - for example, we will spend three days on trying to cluster a group of files into logical folders. If the researcher succeeds only after a few hours - that's great. It might also be that after only one hour of work we find some discomforting surprises (for example, we wanted to group the files based on the I/O operations, but we don't have access to the actual filenames) - we may want to reconsider this track already.

In case we did continue to work on this task for the whole allocate time frame (three days in our example) - we will stop at this point to reconsider. You have decided to spend three days on this task. Consider your research tree. What was your goal in pursuing it? What did you learn? Is this still the most promising path forward?

At this point you may feel like you are very close to getting an answer from this direction, so you may define a new time limit - say, of a single day. In other cases, you may realize that this direction turned out to be harder, and you'd need at least one more week. Perhaps it's time to reconsider.

Time boxing research directions is a tool for research management, acknowledging the inherent challenge of providing time estimations for research tasks. It is not intended to put pressure on a researcher to finish a task "on time".

### Tips for Effective Time-Boxing

When consulting the research tree ([chapter 4](#the-research-tree)), and deciding on tackling a specific research direction, work with these tips in mind:

1. Ask yourself how much time you anticipate needing to make meaningful progress on this direction. In general, you need to know whether it's short than a day, around a few days, or longer than a week.
2. In case it's shorter than a day - just get it done. You can time-box it for a single day, but don't overthink it.
3. In case it's a few days - define a time box of 2-5 days, depending on the estimation. I usually time-box for a bit less than the expected time - for example, if I estimate 4 days, I may time-box for 3 days. The goal is to stop and reconsider given the additional information you have at that point, not to pressure you to finish the task.
4. In case it's longer than a week - define a time box of one week. I don't see any case where *not* stopping to consider after a week is desirable.

Don't overthink time-boxing, especially not the exact time limits. The goal is to create natural stopping points to reconsider your research directions.
