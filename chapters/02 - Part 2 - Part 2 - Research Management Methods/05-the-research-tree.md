## Chapter 4 - The Research Tree {#the-research-tree}

You've probably seen this: An engineer/researcher starts down one path, hits an obstacle, tries something else, hits another obstacle, then tries a third approach. Three weeks later, they're still stuck - or worse, they've built something that technically works but doesn't solve the actual problem.

The issue isn't persistence. It's that they never mapped out the solution space. They never visualized **which** approaches might work, **which questions** need answering, and **how** everything relates to each other.

**The Research Tree solves this problem.**

It is a way to visualize and manage the **Control** component of Schoenfeld's framework from [chapter 1](#what-is-research) - monitoring and adjusting your approach. This is where most Research efforts struggle.

### What Is a Research Tree?

A Research Tree is a living visual representation of your Research journey. It captures three things:

1. **Possible solution paths** - different approaches you might take.
2. **Open questions** - what you need to learn.
3. **Closed questions** - what you've already discovered.

Unlike a static plan, the Research Tree grows and changes as you learn (which is one reason I like the name "tree" ðŸ˜‡). You start with what you know, then update it continuously as you investigate. Dead ends get marked. New branches appear. Questions get answered and new questions emerge.

Think of it like this: You're exploring a cave system. You don't have a map - you're *creating* the map as you explore. You mark passages you've tried. You note which ones are dead ends. You write down questions: "Does this passage connect to the main chamber?" "Is there water down this route?" As you explore, you answer some questions and discover new ones you hadn't considered.

Research works the same way. The Research Tree is both your map and your log.

### Your First Research Tree

Let's build one together. Consider a common engineering challenge:

**Goal: Reduce API response time from 800ms to under 100ms**

You start with a fundamental question that needs answering. What's the first thing you need to know?

Take a moment to think about this before reading on.

The first question is usually: **Where is the bottleneck?**

Until you answer this, you don't know which approaches make sense. Let's draw this:

```
    Reduce API Response Time
              |
              |
      Where is the bottleneck?
```

Now, how can you answer this question? What approaches might tell you where the bottleneck is?

You might identify:
- Profile the application with a performance monitoring tool.
- Add detailed logging to measure each operation.
- Use database query analysis tools.

Let's add these as branches:

```
    Reduce API Response Time
              |
              |
      Where is the bottleneck?
              |
       _______|________
      |       |        |
   Profile  Logging  DB Analysis
    (Yellow) (Yellow) (Yellow)
```

Each approach is an investigation you could run to answer the question.

### The Power of Stopping to Think

Before we go further, notice what just happened. **You stopped.**

Instead of immediately jumping into "Let's add more logging!" or "I bet it's the database, let's check queries," you identified multiple possible approaches. You're looking at three different ways to answer the same question.

This is already valuable. Most engineers would have jumped straight into whichever approach came to mind first. Maybe you've done this yourself - spent two days adding detailed logging, only to discover later that a profiler would have given you the answer in 30 minutes.

By creating this tree, you've avoided that trap. You can see all the approaches before committing to any of them. It doesn't guarantee you will choose the "right" path - you can't always do that in advance, but it will minimize the chances of you omitting it completely.

Remember the reverse engineering students from [chapter 3](#why-methodology-matters)? They never created this tree. They jumped straight to the first approach they knew: disassemblers and debuggers. They didn't stop to think: "What are all the ways we could understand this game's rules?" If they had, they would have listed approaches like: reverse engineer the binary, check the Help menu, examine config files, watch network traffic. And if they'd evaluated those approaches using the framework you're about to learn, "check the Help menu" would have scored perfectly: fastest feedback (30 seconds), lowest cost (zero), best coverage (complete rules). Instead, they spent hours on complex reverse engineering when a simple menu click would have worked. Don't be those students.

**Now comes the critical question: Which branch do you try first?**

### Choosing Your First Path

You're looking at three approaches: Profile, Logging, DB Analysis. Each is a **heuristic** (in Schoenfeld's terms, as presented in [chapter 1](#what-is-research)) - a problem-solving strategy that might work. How do you decide which one to try?

Sometimes, the answer is obvious (I wouldn't really use a framework to check if there's a "Help" menu). Let me show you the framework I use when it's not so clear which path to choose. Ask yourself these questions:

**1. Which gives the fastest feedback?**

How long until you get an answer?

- Profile: Can run in 10 minutes. Setup is probably 5 minutes.
- Logging: Need to add logging code, deploy, wait for traffic - maybe 4 hours.
- DB Analysis: Need to enable slow query log, wait for data - maybe 2 hours.

**Fastest feedback wins.** You want to learn quickly. If an approach can give you an answer in 15 minutes versus 4 hours, try the fast one first.

**2. Which has the lowest cost?**

What do you need to set up or change?

- Profile: Just attach a profiler - no code changes.
- Logging: Need to modify code, test, deploy.
- DB Analysis: Need database permissions, might need config changes.

**Lower cost wins.** Why spend hours adding logging if you can get the answer without changing any code?

(In your environment - it may be different. Perhaps logging is really easy, while profiling is super hard to set up. I am not claiming that profiling is a better heuristic than logging - it depends on your circumstances.)

**3. Which answers the most questions?**

Some approaches answer not just your immediate question, but related questions too.

- Profile: Shows you CPU, memory, database, network - a complete picture.
- Logging: Only shows what you logged.
- DB Analysis: Only shows database queries.

**Broader coverage wins.** A profiler might show you that 70% of time is database queries *and* that 20% is network latency - information you wouldn't get from narrow approaches.

So this is an easy one. **Profiling wins on all three criteria.** That's your first approach to try.

Update your tree:

```
    Reduce API Response Time
              |
              |
      Where is the bottleneck?
              |
       _______|________
      |       |        |
   Profile  Logging  DB Analysis
    [TRY     (Yellow) (Yellow)
    FIRST]   
```

This doesn't mean the other approaches are bad. It means that profiling is the best *starting point* given what you know right now.

### What If Your First Choice Doesn't Work?

Let's say you try profiling and hit a problem: Your profiler can't attach to the production environment due to security restrictions.

**This is valuable information.** Mark Profile as Red and move to your next best option:

```
    Reduce API Response Time
              |
              |
      Where is the bottleneck?
              |
       _______|________
      |       |        |
   Profile  Logging  DB Analysis
    (Red:    [TRY    (Yellow)
   Can't run SECOND]
   in prod)   
```

Now you try Logging. But notice: You didn't waste days trying Profile in production. You tried it, hit a blocker, immediately pivoted to Logging. The tree helped you move quickly.

### Choosing When Everything Seems Equal

Sometimes multiple approaches look equally good. Profile and DB Analysis might both be fast, low-cost, and have decent coverage. How do you choose?

**Pick one and move on.** Don't spend an hour analyzing which approach to try for 30 minutes. The meta-work (deciding) shouldn't take longer than the actual work (trying it).

When approaches seem equal, ask: "Which one am I more familiar with?" or "Which one does the team have experience with?" Use your judgment, make a choice, and start learning.

The worst decision is no decision.

In general, this approach might feel like an over-kill. Should you really sketch out trees and compare branches before actually doing something?

The surprising answer is that while almost always it feels like an over-kill - almost every single time, it turns out to be worth it. Try it a few times and you will see for yourself.

### Heuristics Can Be Combined

Sometimes you don't have to choose just one. You might run Profile *and* enable DB Analysis simultaneously. If they don't conflict and you have the time, parallel investigations can be powerful.

But be careful: Don't try to do everything at once. Start with your best option. If that doesn't fully answer your question, then add another approach.

```
    Where is the bottleneck?
              |
       _______|________
      |       |        |
   Profile  Logging  DB Analysis
  (Trying   (Yellow)  (Trying in
   first)             parallel)
```

### How Answers Lead to New Questions

Let's say you choose "Profile" and run it for a day. You discover: **70% of response time is database queries**.

This answer eliminates the need for other approaches (you don't need logging now - you found the answer). But more importantly, it reveals new questions:

```
    Reduce API Response Time
              |
              |
      Where is the bottleneck? 
      CLOSED: Database queries (70%)
              |
       _______|________
      |                |
Which queries      How many queries
are slowest?       per request?
  (Open)              (Open)
```

See how the tree grows? One answered question spawns two new questions. Each of these new questions will have its own approaches for answering them.

And you'll apply the same framework to choose which question to answer first: Which gives fastest feedback? Which has lowest cost? Which answers the most questions?

Let's expand "Which queries are slowest?":

```
    Which queries are slowest?
              |
       _______|________
      |       |        |
   Enable  Query    Sample
   Slow    Profiler Production
   Query              Traffic
   Log
 (Yellow)  (Yellow)   (Yellow)
```

Again, you'd evaluate: Which approach gives fastest feedback? Enable Slow Query Log is probably fastest - you just flip a config flag and wait a few minutes.

You decide to enable the slow query log. After investigating, you discover: **User profile queries are slowest - they make 15 separate database calls (N+1 problem)**.

This answer leads to a new question:

```
    Which queries are slowest?
    CLOSED: User profile queries (N+1 - 15 calls)
              |
              |
    How can we fix the N+1 problem?
              |
       _______|________
      |       |        |
   Rewrite  Add      Use
   with     Eager    DataLoader
   Joins    Loading  Pattern
 (Yellow)  (Yellow)   (Yellow)
```

Now you have three solution approaches. Again, evaluate them:
- Rewrite with Joins: Fast to implement, proven pattern.
- Add Eager Loading: Depends on your ORM, might be quick.
- DataLoader Pattern: Requires learning new pattern, takes longer.

Rewrite with Joins probably gives fastest feedback if your team knows SQL well.

### The Complete Picture

Let's see how the full tree looks after a few days of investigation:

```
    Reduce API Response Time (800ms â†’ 100ms)
              |
              |
      Where is the bottleneck?
      CLOSED: Database queries (70% of time)
              |
       _______|_________________
      |                         |
Which queries are          How many queries
slowest?                   per request?
CLOSED: User profiles      CLOSED: 15-20 queries
(N+1 - 15 calls)           |
      |                    |
      |                    Can we reduce
How can we fix             query count?
the N+1 problem?           (Open)
      |                         |
   ___|___                   ___|___
  |   |   |                 |       |
Rewrite Add  Data         Batch   Redesign
Joins  Eager Loader       Requests  API
(Green)(Yellow)(Yellow)   (Yellow)  (Red)
```

**Reading this tree:**

1. We started with "Where is the bottleneck?" and chose profiling (fastest feedback).
2. That answer led to two new questions about specific queries.
3. For "Which queries are slowest?", we chose slow query log (fastest to enable).
4. Answering it led to another question about fixing the N+1 problem.
5. For "How can we fix N+1?", we evaluated the approaches and chose "Rewrite with Joins" (team knows SQL, fastest to implement).
6. Meanwhile, "Can we reduce query count?" is still open and has its own approaches to investigate.

### Color-Coding Status

Mark both questions and approaches with status:

**For Questions:**
- **Open**: Not yet answered
- **Closed**: Answered (show the answer)
- **Blocking**: Must answer before proceeding with an approach

**For Approaches:**
- **Green**: Viable, worth pursuing
- **Yellow**: Uncertain, needs investigation  
- **Red**: Dead end or not viable

In our example above:
- "Rewrite with Joins" is Green because we've identified it addresses the specific N+1 problem and the team is confident in implementing it.
- "Redesign API" is Red because it would take too long for this project.
- Other approaches are Yellow because we haven't investigated them yet.

### Why This Works

The Research Tree with this decision-making framework addresses five critical failure modes:

**1. Jumping on First Idea**
Without a tree, people implement the first approach they think of. The tree forces you to identify alternatives and evaluate them systematically before starting.

**2. Tunnel Vision**
People lock onto one approach without considering alternatives. The tree makes alternatives visible and helps you choose the best starting point.

**3. Inefficient Learning**
Teams try expensive, slow approaches first when faster, cheaper ones exist. The decision framework helps you learn quickly.

**4. Answering Questions You Don't Need To**
Teams waste time investigating interesting but irrelevant questions. The tree shows how questions connect - you only need to answer questions that lead to your goal.

**5. Lost Context**
When you hit a roadblock, you need to know which question you were trying to answer and what other approaches exist. The tree provides that context.

### Time to Practice

Open your favorite drawing tool - or just grab a piece of paper. Think of a Research problem you're currently facing or recently faced.

Now answer these questions:

1. What's your goal? Write it at the top.
2. What's the first question you need to answer? Write it below the goal.
3. What are 2-4 approaches to answer that question? Draw them as branches.
4. For each approach, evaluate:
   - How fast is the feedback?
   - What's the cost?
   - How much does it answer?
5. Which approach scores best? Mark it "TRY FIRST"

Actually do this. Don't just read and think "I understand." Drawing the tree and evaluating approaches forces you to be explicit, and you'll immediately see gaps in your thinking.

I'll wait.

...

Done? Good. You now have your first Research Tree with a clear starting point.

### Using the Tree with Your Team

Research Trees become even more powerful when shared with a team. It actually provides you, the Lead, with a way to see what directions the team is executing upon, and why. Your job here is to make sure the framework is used. Help your team stop and ask - are we asking the right questions? Are there approaches that we missed? Are we choosing the right approach?

**During Planning:**
- Draw the tree together as a group.
- Brainstorm questions and approaches.
- Evaluate approaches using the framework (fastest feedback, lowest cost, best coverage).
- Everyone sees *why* you're trying a particular approach first.

**During Execution:**
- Update the tree as you learn.
- When stuck, revisit the tree to identify alternative approaches.
- When an approach fails, mark it Red and move to the next best option.
- Regular tree reviews (weekly or bi-weekly).

### Template and Tools

Here's a simple template to start with:

```
                    [GOAL]
                       |
                       |
                [First Question?]
                   (Status)
                       |
            ___________|___________
           |           |           |
      [Approach A] [Approach B] [Approach C]
       (Status)     (Status)     (Status)
      [Evaluate:   [Evaluate:   [Evaluate:
       Fast/Cheap] Slow/Exp]    Med/Med]
           
    
    [First Question?]
    CLOSED: [Answer]
           |
    _______|________
   |                |
[Question 2?]  [Question 3?]
arising from   arising from
Answer         Answer
   |               |
 Approaches    Approaches
 to answer     to answer
   Q2            Q3
```

**Key elements:**
- Start with your goal at the root.
- First question branches from the goal.
- Approaches to answer that question branch from it.
- Evaluate each approach (feedback speed, cost, coverage).
- Mark your best starting point.
- When you answer a question, new questions branch from the answer.
- Mark questions as Open/Closed/Blocking.
- Mark approaches as Green/Yellow/Red.

**Tools you can use:**
- Pen and paper (seriously, this works great).
- Whiteboard (for team sessions).
- Miro, Mural, or similar digital whiteboards.
- Mind mapping software (XMind, MindNode, etc.).
- Even a simple text file with indentation.

The tool doesn't matter. What matters is that the tree exists, is visible, and gets updated.

### Pro Tips

**Start with the most important question**

Don't try to list all possible questions upfront. Start with the one question that, if answered, would most clarify your path forward. Answer it, then see what new questions emerge.
<TBD - link to drawing backwards>

**Show how answers lead to new questions**

When you close a question, immediately ask: "What new questions does this answer reveal?" Draw those as branches from the answer.

**Update questions weekly**

In your weekly check-ins, explicitly review: Which questions did we close? What did we learn? Which new questions emerged? Which questions are blocking progress?

**Re-evaluate when context changes**

If you learn something new that changes the evaluation (maybe a tool you thought was fast turns out to be slow), re-evaluate your approaches. The tree is living - update it.

### Recap - The Research Tree

The Research Tree is a living visual framework that:

- Shows questions you need to answer to reach your goal.
- Maps approaches for answering each question.
- Helps you choose the best starting point for each question.
- Prevents jumping on the first idea without considering alternatives.
- Captures how answers lead to new questions.
- Tracks status of questions (open/closed/blocking) and approaches (green/yellow/red).
- Documents the investigation path so the team understands why decisions were made.
- Evolves as you learn - questions get answered, new questions emerge.

**Key structure:**
- Goal â†’ Question â†’ Approaches to answer it â†’ Answer â†’ New questions

**Decision framework for choosing approaches:**
1. Which gives fastest feedback?
2. Which has lowest cost?
3. Which answers the most questions?

In the next chapter, you'll learn how to manage execution using time-boxing and decision points to keep your Research moving forward without getting stuck.
