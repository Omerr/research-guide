To decide whether you should pursue a research task...
The need comes from the clients
You conduct pre-research to understand the problem

You get a senfe if you have the right people for it
You assign some time to make a more educated decision

Break down of leader goals (high level in chapter 3)

The main roles of a leader, when it comes to Research tasks, are:
1. Connect the Research to the Product.
2. Ask the right questions.
3. Puruse the right heuristics to answer these questions.

Taking shortcuts - 80-20 rule.
