## Part 3 Summary {#part3-summary}

In [chapter 2](#research-and-development), you learned that your role as a Research leader is to:
1. Ensure Research connects to product impact.
2. Ensure Research is done effectively.

[Part 2](#part2-research-management-methods) handled ensuring Research is done effectively. This part discussed ensuring that Research connects to product impact - your most important responsibility.

**The Three Stages of Product-Led Research**

Part 3 provided a complete methodology for ensuring product impact through three complementary stages:

**Stage 1: Choose research that matters** ([chapter 6](#how-to-choose-research-initiatives))

Before starting any Research, answer three critical questions:
1. **Product impact** - Will success create huge value?
2. **Time to impact** - How long until we see product results?
3. **Resources** - Do we have the knowledge, capacity, and dependencies?

You learned to distinguish between problem-driven research (starting from validated customer pain points, which is strongly preferred) and opportunity-driven research (starting from new technologies).

Run focused pre-research checks to answer these questions. Only pursue Research when confident about substantial product impact.

**Stage 2: Start from product value and work backwards** ([chapter 7](#drawing-backwards))

Once you've chosen what to research, the drawing backwards heuristic ensures that you start right. Instead of diving into technical challenges, start from the end:

1. **Manually create the desired output** - What should successful Research produce? Create it by hand before solving any technical problems.
2. **Validate with stakeholders or customers** - Show them the output and confirm it solves their problem.
3. **Work backwards through dependencies** - From that validated output, identify what you need to produce it, then what you need for that, working your way back to your starting point.
4. **Solve in reverse order** - Tackle the final step first (with earlier steps mocked), validating that each step contributes to the goal before investing heavily in earlier dependencies.

The spiral game example showed why this works: working backwards from the goal reveals systematic solutions that working forward obscures.

Drawing backwards forces product connection because you literally start with product output. It integrates with the Research Tree ([chapter 4]({#the-research-tree})): While drawing backwards identifies *what* questions matter, the Tree helps you explore approaches for answering them.

**Stage 3: Validate and build iteratively** ([chapter 8](#end-to-end))

Drawing backwards alone has two limitations:
- Your manually-created "ideal output" might be technically infeasible to generate.
- You haven't validated on real user data.

End-to-end Iterations address both limitations. These two tools aren't competing approaches - rather, they complement one another:

**How the Three Stages Work Together**

These chapters form a complete methodology for product-led Research:

**Choose** → **Start from the end** → **Validate iteratively**

- **[Chapter 6](#how-to-choose-research-initiatives)** ensures you choose research that COULD have huge impact (strategic decision).
- **[Chapter 7](#drawing-backwards)** ensures you start from product value (planning backward from validated output).
- **[Chapter 8](#end-to-end)** ensures you continuously validate with real users.

Each stage prevents different undesired, but painfully common outcomes:
- **[Chapter 6](#how-to-choose-research-initiatives)** prevents pursuing research that won't matter (even if successful).
- **[Chapter 7](#drawing-backwards)** prevents building technically correct solutions that don't create product value.
- **[Chapter 8](#end-to-end)** prevents building infeasible solutions or solutions that fail on real data.

You now have the complete answer to "How do I ensure Research impacts the product?":

1. **Choose wisely** - Only pursue research with clear, huge product impact.
2. **Start from product value** - Manually create and validate desired output before technical work.
3. **Work backwards** - Identify dependencies from output back to starting point.
4. **Build end-to-end fast** - Get entire chain working with shortcuts and manual steps.
5. **Ship to real users** - Validate on actual data, not just examples.
6. **Iterate based on learning** - Improve the chain incrementally, prioritizing what teaches you most.

This methodology keeps product impact central at every stage: choosing, planning, and executing. It prevents the most expensive failure: "successful" Research that doesn't affect the product.
