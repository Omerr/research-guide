# Introduction {#introduction}

Your team needs to solve a problem. There's no clear solution path. Multiple approaches might work, but you're not sure which. Success isn't guaranteed.

This is Research, not Development. And if you're managing it like Development, things aren't going well.

Maybe you've seen this: A talented engineer spends three weeks trying different approaches, switching between them until the original problem is no longer relevant. Or a researcher declares after two days "it's impossible" and gives up, though later it turns out the problem was actually solvable. Or worse and most frustrating of all - Research succeeds technically but doesn't impact the product, and you realize you've been solving the wrong problem.

Here's the thing: **managing Research is fundamentally different from managing Development.**

Development has known solution paths, relatively predictable timelines, and measurable progress. You probably learned to manage Development, and know how to do it well. Managing Development is challenging, yet there are established best practices that are well known in the industry.

But Research? Research is inherently uncertain. The techniques that work for Development fail spectacularly for Research. Most organizations either approach Research by deploying techniques devised for managing Development, or entirely give up on managing Research and treat it as mystical work by brilliant people, where the best you can do is not interrupt.

It doesn't have to be this way.

## What You'll Learn

By reading this book, you will gain practical tools for managing Research that creates real product impact.

You will learn your **two critical roles as a Research leader**:

1. Ensure Research connects to product impact.
2. Ensure Research is done effectively.

You will understand *why* Research is different from Development. You will get concrete tools for managing Research execution, and learn proven heuristics for ensuring product impact.

Throughout the book, you'll see the mentioned methods applied to real challenges.

You will feel **confident** managing Research. You will **understand** when to use which tools. You will know how to keep Research connected to product value while managing its inherent uncertainty.

## Who Is This Book For?

Any engineering leader who manages Research, or has researchers on their team.

If you're a CTO, VP of Engineering, R&D Director, or Engineering Manager responsible for Research initiatives — this book is for you.

This book is for product-focused leaders who need their Research to ship value, not just produce interesting findings.

You will also notice that I use a casual style throughout the book. I believe that learning Research management should be insightful and practical. These are hard problems, and writing in an overly academic style wouldn't serve you well. This book is for *you*, written to help you succeed.

## Who Am I?

This book is about you, and your journey managing Research. But let me tell you why I think I can contribute to that journey.

I am the CTO and co-founder of Swimm.io, a knowledge management platform for code. At Swimm, I've led multiple Research initiatives — from automatically keeping documentation in sync with code changes, to extracting business rules from legacy COBOL systems. We've faced genuine Research challenges where the path to success wasn't clear, where we didn't know if solutions were even possible.

I've managed Research in product environments where "interesting findings" aren't enough — where Research must ship and create measurable value. I've experienced the failure modes firsthand: Research that succeeded technically but didn't impact the product, teams that got stuck exploring endlessly, and the challenge of managing uncertainty while maintaining velocity.

I've also managed teams of researchers — brilliant people who needed guidance not on technical capability, but on connecting their work to product value and working systematically through uncertainty.

This book combines my experience leading product-focused Research with my background in teaching and making complex ideas practical and actionable.

## The Approach of This Book

This is not an academic piece on Research methodology. When writing it, I had three principles in mind:

**1. Practical** - In this book, you will learn how to accomplish things in Research management. You will understand frameworks not just for the sake of understanding, but with a practical mindset. I sometimes refer to this as the "practicality principle" - which guides me in deciding whether to include certain topics, and to what extent.

**2. Based on proven theory** - While practical, the methods are grounded in Alan Schoenfeld's problem-solving research — a framework developed by studying how people actually solve uncertain problems. You'll see how Schoenfeld's components (knowledge, heuristics, control, beliefs) map directly to practical Research management tools.

**3. Real examples** - You will see these methods applied to actual Research challenges. Not toy problems, but real initiatives involving complex problems with genuine uncertainty. These examples show the methods in action, including when they're messy, when approaches fail, and how to adapt.

## Structure of This Book

The book is organized in three parts:

**Part 1: Foundations** - Read this to understand what makes Research different and why it needs specialized management. This part is short — just enough to establish the framework that organizes everything else.

**Part 2: Research Management Methods** - These are tools that work for *any* Research. 

**Part 3: Ensuring Product Impact** - Methods specifically for connecting Research to product value.

## Feedback Is Welcome

I created this book to help you and people like you manage Research effectively and ensure it creates product impact.

From the beginning, I asked for feedback from experienced leaders and researchers to make sure the book achieves these goals. If you found something valuable, felt something was missing, or thought something needed improvement — I would love to hear from you.

Your feedback helps make this book better for everyone. Please reach out at: gitting.things@gmail.com.

Now, let's begin. In Chapter 1, you'll learn exactly what makes Research different from Development, and why managing them differently matters.
