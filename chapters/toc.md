   v2:
   Recommended Structure
Part 1: Foundations (Keep SHORT - ~2 chapters)
Goal: Establish just enough theory to justify the methods
Chapter 1: What is Research?

Schoenfeld's framework (current chapter 1)
Research vs. Development (current chapter 2)
Key change: Make this MUCH shorter. Just enough to say "research = uncertain path + needs heuristics + needs control"

Chapter 2: Your Role as a Research Leader

Brief chapter on the leader's responsibilities:

Connect research to product
Ask the right questions
Guide the choice of heuristics


This bridges to the practical methods


Part 2: Research Management Methods (The "HOW")
Goal: Teach the concrete tools - Research Tree, Brainstorming, TTL
Chapter 3: The Research Tree Method

What it is and why it works (connects to Schoenfeld's "control")
How to build and maintain one
Real example from your experience (COBOL? Something visual)
How it enables: understanding current state, zooming in/out, tracking open questions

Chapter 4: Generating Research Directions

Structured brainstorming (the two types from your transcript)
From goals vs. from technology
Working as a team vs. solo
Real examples

Chapter 5: Managing Research Execution

TTL (Time To Live) method - time-boxing with decision points
Prioritization frameworks (your comparison table approach)
Progress tracking without stifling exploration
When to pivot vs. persist


Part 3: Research for Product Impact (The "APPLY")
Goal: Specialized techniques for product-driven research
Chapter 6: Choosing Research Initiatives

From problems vs. from opportunities (current chapter 4)
Pre-research validation
Should you pursue it? (your 3 questions)

Chapter 7: Drawing Backwards

Spiral game example (shorter version)
The COBOL business rules example
Why this is here: It's a specific heuristic that becomes clearer AFTER you understand the research tree

Chapter 8: End-to-End Iteration

The 5 principles
Why this matters for product impact
How it connects to the research tree (you're building the tree AS you iterate)

Chapter 9: Conclusion & Putting It All Together

Brief case studies showing all methods in action
Common pitfalls
How to adapt for your context


Why This Structure Works Better

Shorter theory section: You keep Schoenfeld but make it punchy - just enough to justify WHY you need methods
Immediate practicality: After ~20 pages of theory, readers get concrete tools they can use Monday morning
Clearer connections:

Research Tree is the implementation of Schoenfeld's "control"
Drawing Backwards is now obviously a "heuristic" (Schoenfeld's term)
Your whole methodology becomes the answer to "how do we operationalize Schoenfeld's framework?"


Better flow:

"Here's why research is hard" →
"Here are tools to manage the hardness" →
"Here's how to apply them in a product context"


The reverse engineering story: Move this to Part 2, Chapter 3 - it's perfect for introducing why you need methodology

What to Cut/Consolidate
Looking at your existing chapters:

Chapter 1 (Spiral game): Keep but shorten to 50% - just enough to introduce Schoenfeld
Chapter 2: Keep but merge best practices into other chapters
Empty Part 3 chapters: These become your Part 2 with the Hebrew transcript content
Chapter 10 (reverse engineering story): Use this to OPEN Part 2 - it's a perfect motivation for why methodology matters

The Payoff
With this structure:

A manager reads Part 1 (quick) → understands the problem
They read Part 2 (practical) → can implement research tree tomorrow
They read Part 3 (advanced) → can handle product-specific challenges

The Schoenfeld fatigue is gone because you've moved to practical tools quickly, but the Schoenfeld framework now EXPLAINS why your tools work.
