# Part 3 - Product-Led Research

In [chapter 2](#research-and-development), I argued that your role as a Research leader is to:
1. Ensure Research connects to product impact.
2. Ensure Research is done effectively.

While Part 2 handled the latter part of your role - how to ensure Research is done effectively, this part focuses on the former part of your role - how to ensure Research connects to product impact.

This is, by far, the most important part of your role as a Research leader. 

## Chapter 6 - How to Choose Research Initiatives {#how-to-choose-research-initiatives}

The very first step in making sure your Research impacts the product, is choosing the right thing to research, and, just as important - avoid spending time and effort on Research that is not liable to impact the product.

In general, research initiatives can start from two different places:

1. From a problem that the product is facing.
2. From a technological opportunity.

#### 1. From a Concrete Problem

The most promising way to find research initiatives that will have a big impact on the product is to start from an acute problem that the product is facing. For example, at Swimm, we used to allow users to write documents about their code, but inevitably, the code changed, and the documentation became outdated. This made the it not worth the effort of writing documentation in the first place. We needed to find a way to make sure the documentation is always up to date, automatically, and with a good user experience. This was a clear problem we faced, and we didn't know at that time if it was even possible to solve.

Consider a different example - a medical company that wants to diagnose a disease based on a few blood samples. Currently, they have an algorithm in place, but it is not very accurate. Specifically, it yields too many false positives. They need to find a way to improve their prediction accuracy. This is a clear problem that the product is facing, and it doesn't have a clear technological solution.

In both cases, the problem is clear, and its impact on the product or comapny is clear. At the same time, the solution is not clear, and it is not certain that the solution will be technologically feasible.

#### 2. From a Technological Opportunity

When generative AI became popular, many companies started to explore how to leverage it to improve their products. This is an example of an emerging technology that can enable new product features. 

The same can happen from smaller, more specific technologies, and not necessarily new technologies, but rather - technologies that the relevant teams just familiarized themselves with. For example, if a researcher read a paper about a new way to parse source code, that researcher might have an idea for a new product feature that can leverage this technology.

While many good ideas come from technological opportunities, it is important to remember that the real impact of the research is determined by the product, and not the technology. It is way more risky to pursue a technological opportunity than a concrete problem. In that case, your responsibility is to make sure that the technological opportunity, if it is pursued and if the research is successful, will indeed have a big impact on the product.

### Should you Pursue a Research Initiative?

Say you have a research initiative - an idea you would like to research. To know wheter you should pursue it, you should be able to answer a simple set of questions:

1. Product Impact - in case the Research succeeds, how big will the impact be? This is the most crucial question. If you are not convinced a successful Research result would end up making a huge impact on the product, it is probably not worth pursuing.
2. Time to Impact - time estimation is always hard in software. This is true for Development tasks, and even more so for Research. You will learn of ways to manage this uncertainty, but even at this early pre-Research stage, you should ask yourself how long it might take for the task to bear fruit. If the answer is one year, and it's simply too much to invest - it's better to know it now and avoid pursuing this initiative all together.
3. Resources - do you have the right people and resources to enable this Research?

### Pre-Research Checks

You might not have clear answers to all three questions above. In that case, it makes sense to spend time answering them *before* actually pursuing the Research. This phase should be limited in time, ideally for a few days.

In this stage you might want to:

1. Interview clients and business stakeholders to understand the business impact.
2. Read about the technological aspects and previous research done in this field.
3. Consult with people who may have faced similar challenges.

If you decide to pursue an initiative, you should be certain that its impact on the product would be substantial. If you are not sure about this, DO NOT START THE RESEARCH. One more way to enhance your certainty is described in [chapter 5]{#drawing-backwards}.

The next chapters will assume you understand the product impact of successful outcomes of the Research, and will help you make sure you actually achieve this impact as quickly as possible.
