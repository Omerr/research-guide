// Omer Rosenbaum Writing Style Rule

// This rule guides editing content to match Omer Rosenbaum's distinctive writing style

// Voice & Tone
- Use a conversational, friendly tone - write as if speaking directly to the reader
- Address the reader as "you" and refer to yourself as "I" frequently
- Show genuine enthusiasm for technical topics ("isn't that cool?" "Feel free to admire the beauty")
- Personify Git with human characteristics ("Git believes", "Git thinks", "Git wants")
- Insert occasional emoticons (ðŸ˜Š, ðŸ˜Ž, ðŸ˜‡) after explaining concepts or making puns
- Incorporate Git-related wordplay ("Gitting things done", "You will *Git* it")
- Be reassuring with complex topics ("don't worry" or "this is not crucial for understanding")
- Frame technical learning as a personal journey with you as the guide

// Structure
- Begin sections with enthusiasm and inviting language
- Use short to medium paragraphs (2-4 sentences) with frequent breaks
- Include rhetorical questions to engage readers and transition between topics
- Build concepts gradually, with foundational ideas before complex applications
- Refer back to earlier explanations when building on concepts
- End substantial sections with brief recaps of key points
- Use clear headings and subheadings to organize content
- Invite exploration with phrases like "Let's see what happens if..." or "Want to try this yourself?"

// Technical Content
- Frame explanations assuming reader curiosity but not expertise
- Emphasize understanding "why" something works, not just "how"
- Use analogies from everyday life to explain Git concepts
- Show step-by-step processes with command examples and outputs
- Explicitly encourage hands-on practice ("I encourage you to run the commands yourself")
- Suggest drawing out Git structures to visualize concepts
- For Git specifically, explain underlying mechanisms to build confidence
- Show practical applications of Git concepts for real-world scenarios

// Formatting
- Format commands in code blocks followed by explanation of results
- Use **bold** for key terms and important Git concepts when first introduced
- Use numbered lists for sequential processes and bullet points for non-sequential items
- Include explicit references to any diagrams or images ("Consider the drawing above")
- Include screenshots of command outputs where helpful

// Language Patterns
- Use contractions naturally ("don't", "isn't", "you'll")
- Include rhetorical confirmation phrases like "That's right..." or "Correct"
- Create hypothetical scenarios to illustrate concepts
- Cross-reference other sections with phrases like "As we explained earlier in..."
- Use specific Omer phrases:
  - "Let's get to it!"
  - "Pretty cool, huh? ðŸ˜Ž"
  - "Can you see where I am going? ðŸ˜‡"
  - "I encourage you to try out the commands alongside this chapter"
  - "As a reminder..." (when referencing previous concepts)
  - "Let me explain..."
  - "Feel free to..."
  - "By the way..."
  - "Note that..."
  - "Intuitively, what you want to do is..."

// What to Avoid
- Formal academic tone ("It can be observed that...")
- Extended technical explanations without examples
- Passive voice ("The command is executed...")
- Complex terminology without explanation
- Overuse of technical jargon without context
- Long paragraphs without breaks
- Presenting concepts without practical application

// Editing Process
1. First pass: Ensure technical accuracy and logical flow
2. Second pass: Add conversational elements and enthusiasm markers
3. Third pass: Insert questions and scenarios to prompt critical thinking
4. Fourth pass: Add Omer-specific phrases and emoticons at appropriate points
5. Final pass: Check for consistent formatting and style

// Examples (Transform from â†’ to)
// From: "The execution of this command results in modification of the repository state."
// To: "When you run this command, Git will update your repository. Let's see what happens! ðŸ˜Š"

// From: "It is important to note that this functionality has limitations."
// To: "I should point out that this feature has some limits - don't worry, I'll guide you through them."

// From: "Users may find it beneficial to employ visualization techniques."
// To: "I highly recommend drawing this out on a whiteboard - trust me, it'll make so much more sense when you see it!"

// Strong examples to emulate:
// "By reading this book, you will gain a new perspective of Git. You will feel **confident** when working with Git, and you will **understand** Git's underlying mechanisms, at least those that are useful to understand. You will *Git* it. You will be *Gitting things done*."

// "Oh wow, isn't that cool? ðŸ˜Ž `git rebase` grants you unlimited control over the shape of any branch. You can use it to reorder commits, or to remove incorrect changes, or modify a change in retrospect."

// "What would happen if I used this command again? And ran `git reset --hard HEAD@{1}`? Git would set `HEAD` to where `HEAD` was pointing before the last `reset`, meaning to 'Commit 2'. We can keep going all day!"
